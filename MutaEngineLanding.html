            <h2>What is a Polymorphic <br>Code Engine?</h2>
            <img src="Illu1.svg">
            <p class="btext">The Polymorphic Code Engine is a revolutionary technology designed to protect software from
                reverse engineering and unauthorized modifications. By dynamically altering the software's source code,
                it provides a robust layer of security that is difficult for hackers to bypass.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td style="padding-right: 50px;">The engine constantly changes the software's source code in
                        real-time. Whenever a tool tries to access the source code, it starts to mutate, making it
                        almost impossible for hackers to break it down.</td>
                    <td style="padding-left: 50px;">By continuously altering the code, the engine makes reverse
                        engineering and decompilation extremely difficult, protecting the software from unauthorized use
                        and distribution.</td>
